# Tic-Tac-Toe

____________________________________

Welcome to my first project, which is a simple game of Tic Tac Toe! This game was made by using HTML, CSS, JS and Python. There is a custom theme option as well as the choice to play with a person locally or play with an AI.

_How does it all work?_

* When launched, the user is met with the standard layout for the game, which is just black and white. The user has the option to cycle to the other themes, which are a dark theme and a colorful theme. 

* After selecting a theme, the user can start the game by selecting if they want to play against a computerized AI or if they want to play with someone locally. That would mean that one person would have to select their boxes as X and the opponent will do so for O. 

* There is a scoreboard at the top that keeps track of who is in the lead, and once the game needs to be concluded, there is a restart button at the bottom that will reset the scoreboard.
